# grpc-demo

Full demo of my nodejs CLI tools for grpc

It's meant to show to use all the CLI tools, with no code other than your endpoint implementation.

## usage

* `npm install` - to install dependencies
* `npm run grpc` - to start gRPC server
* `npm run gateway` - start gateway
* `npm run ls` - list defined interface
* `npm test` - run a gRPC client test
* `npm start` - start the grpc server & gateway at once
